Amulets:
    As a bonus action, you can transform into the creature contained in the amulet, but with a fifth of the hit points. You can stay in this form for up to a minute, or until you lose all of the creature's hit points. You may also exit the form at will.
    If your transformation ended due to losing hit points, you cannot transform again until you complete a long rest. Otherwise, you cannot transform again until you complete a short rest.
    While in this form, you retain all magical bonuses from your gear.
    Amulets are created with a certain CR capacity. You can combine multiple amulets to create an amulet with a higher CR capacity (resulting amulet's CR is the highest CR whose XP is lower than the sum of the given amulet CR XPs)
    You can pay 10 * CR gold to replace the creature in an amulet
    Any temporary hit points you gain while transformed, or have when transforming, are also divided by five. Any temporary hit points you have when transforming back to your original form are multiplied by 5.

Prayer Stones:
    You can use any prayer stone to pray to any Deity, but when using the appropriate prayer stone, you get the option of skipping a step

Wands:
    Local wand bonuses apply to spells
    While using a wand, you may choose to make cantrip spells with a spell save DC as spell attacks

Spell Focus:
    +1 spell save DC, +1 spell AB

Moving mods:
    Between weapons, so long as all mods are compatible with new weapon. Incompatible mods can be removed as part of the transfer.

Relics:
    Relics related to a specific personality are unlocked at a certain quest state.
    Relics can only be attuned to one person (old attunements need to be let go, but artifacts are found without attunements). Attunements simply provide a free level up (1 -> 2).
    Mods with a weighting of <= 3 are not upgradeable until level 10.
    Last relic level (10) is a choice of level (new random mod from list of mods available on artifact, upgrade existing mod of choice, new random mod)
